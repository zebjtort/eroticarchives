An unimaginable part of Mexico’s film heritage was lost: the fire destroyed some 6,506 films, 3,300 of which were Mexican features and shorts, as well as the Cineteca’s library, which held some 9,000 specialized books and film journals, 2,000 film scripts, and other irreplaceable print ephemera. Mexico’s silent films, largely produced between 1896 and 1929, are especially vulnerable as historical documents, and many were lost even prior to 1982. Archives such as the <strong><a href=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/introduction-to-archiving-the-obscene.html\">Filmoteca de la UNAM</a></strong>—founded in 1960 and housed in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México—have been crucial in recovering, restoring, and conserving Mexico’s film history, yet so too have private collectors, flea market dealers, and a range of other institutional and community-based archives, both within Mexico and in other countries, especially the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>Even more precarious than those films that were once archived (and later lost) are those that, because of their explicitly erotic or “pornographic” content were deemed by local authorities and the Catholic Church as “obscene,” and were therefore heavily censored and rarely ended up in <em><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">any</span></em> archival collection. So much of historical pornography (and “obscene” artifacts) enters and exits collections—being multiply used and reused, shifting hands of ownership, being censored, being discarded and disposed, being recovered, reentering circulation in the public sphere—and occasionally ending up in archives. Indeed, my own project began in 2016, when I purchased an amateur Mexican erotic film (an 8 mm film from the late 1960s, which features two woman and a man having sex) in a massive outdoor flea market in Mexico City, La Lagunilla, and subsequently donated that film to the Filmoteca de la UNAM, once of the country's most important film archives, housed at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México <strong>(Image 1)</strong>. Archivists at the Filmoteca warmly received my donation, and invited me to witness and participate in the process of restoring this film to include in the Filmoteca's collections and make it publicly available (<strong>Image 2</strong>). </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/FIGURE-2.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  alt=\"Antique vendor’s goods for sale at the Sunday morning market at La Lagunilla, with the 8 mm amateur Mexican pornographic film reel that I purchased and donated to the Filmoteca on the bottom right.\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Image 1: Antique<em> vendor’s goods for sale at the Sunday morning market at La Lagunilla, with the 8 mm amateur Mexican pornographic film reel that I purchased and donated in 2016 to the Filmoteca de la UNAM, visible on the bottom right.</em></strong></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/FIGURE-3.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-md.jpeg 768w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Image 2: Mario</strong><em><strong> Tovar, of the Departmento de Catalogación of the Filmoteca de la UNAM, splicing and repairing damaged frames from the 8 mm film that I donated to the archives.

This long-term project is twofold, and will culminate in a traditional scholarly monograph as well as in the creation of a digital archive that has become a necessary precondition for the research itself. This project will be the first of its kind to trace the unstable and constantly shifting ideas around obscenity in Latin American history. It too will be the first to digitally archive—in collaboration with the Mexico City-based community archives, <strong><a href=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/introduction-to-archiving-the-obscene.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.elinsulto.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Archivo El Insulto</a></strong>—a growing corpus of Latin American print, photographic, and moving image records related to histories of sexuality for the benefit of researchers, students, activists, archivists, collectors, and artists.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Digital Humanities course, I have decided to visualize three key aspects of this project, which help us gain a better sense of how “obscene” and putatively “immoral” artifacts traveled into Mexico, from the early eighteenth century to the present. <em>Archiving the “Obscene,” </em>begins with the Bourbon Reforms, focusing on 1700-1821, when the various tribunals of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Mexico, Peru, and New Granada censored a diversity of “obscene” and “immoral” artifacts including prints, etchings, drawings, glass plates, statues, dolls, and snuffboxes, among other items, punishing those who produced, commercialized or otherwise circulated them in the public sphere. In my larger project, I am working with dozens of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Inquisition records related to obscenity and pornography, many of which have been incisively analyzed by art historians Kelly Donahue-Wallace and Elizabeth Alice Lamar Latham, who point to the erotic “watches, snuff boxes, and other examples of visual culture that included indecent pictures [and] enriched the visual landscape of the late colonial period.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>My first visualization (a work in progress, admittedly!) therefore focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and works through some of these local and global connections employing a Flourish Connection Globe to envision—through a handful eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Mexican Inquition trials—to think through some of the very real, partly imagined, and strategically fabricated trajectories which some of those confiscated “immoral,” “obscene,” and “pornographic” artifacts took. What I find particularly interesting about the graph below is that, in a very real sense (although currently my dataset is admittedly small, through the corpus is growing with each archival trip to Mexico City) we can see some of the ways that erotic artifacts spread across the globe, largely from Europe into Mexico. There are dozens of Mexican Inquisition cases (which I am still reading through) that gesture to the European provenance of such artifacts, yet there is a certain unknowability that adheres to the objects themselves, as confiscated, (temporarily?) archived, and eventually lost to posterity. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-globe\" data-src=\"visualisation/9016905\">\n<script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p>To get a more microhistorical sense of the cases themselves, and some of the “obscene” artifacts around which they revolved, I turn to fragments of the cases themselves. Housed in Mexico’s national archives, the <strong><a href=\"https://archivos.gob.mx/guiageneral/\">Archivo General de la Nación</a></strong>, is the following Inquisition trial transcript—one of hundreds of thousands in the files of the Mexican Inquisition. On October 20, 1783 a certain don Antonio Recarei y Camaño, boss of a Mexico City silversmith’s workshop in his late twenties, originally from Galicia, appeared before the <em>comisario </em>of the Holy Office of the Mexican Inquisition, Father don Manuel Bolea. He was called before inquisitors who were following up on a denunciation that he had previously made (which is not part of the archival record), and, like so many others who over the course of the eighteenth century increasingly and voluntarily denounced others for selling or possessing “obscene” images that they had encountered in bookstores, shops, and markets, he did so willingly. When asked if he knew the reasons for his having been summoned by order of the Holy Office, Recarei y Camaño replied that “he presumed being called to testify about an obscene painting that he was shown and presented by don José Rodríguez […] the said painting is found in the case of a French watch [<em>la caja de un reloj</em>] and that even though the said painting does not appear at first sight but upon winding up the spring, one us able to see a man and a woman in extremely dishonest and provocative action on the plate [<em>lámina</em>].”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>According to his testimony, Recarei y Camaño immediately reprimanded the owner of the watch, “telling him that it was a despicable [<em>indigna</em>] thing for a Christian to possess such jewelry, and that he was ready (if he wanted to) to erase it without prejudice against the watch; and that [he asked] ‘For what reason had he purchased such an evil piece?’” Rodríguez’s reply was telling: he was alleged to have replied that he had not purchased it but rather “that it was given to him by a Jewish woman [<em>una Judía</em>] in the Guárico,” a region located in what today is central Venezuela.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[3]</a> Two days later, upon the inquisitors’ ratification of his testimony, Recarei y Camaño asserted that what he’d stated was true, but that he wanted to add that this took place on a feast day near the silversmith’s workshop, on the street of San Francisco “in the second house on the left-hand side,” pointing with specificity to the domestic sphere within which the offending watch was displayed. That Rodríguez exhibited his customized watch to the witness <em>only</em> when the two men were alone, in a private home, gestures to the clandestine homosocial nature of how such objects were often displayed, shared, and circulated locally. It also points to how such circulations were conditioned by gender, class, and religious difference (materialized through the accuser’s assertion that it was a <em>Jewish woman </em>who previously owned the obscene watch). As inquisitors delved more into the details of the suspect, they learned that Rodríguez was originally from Castilla la Vieja in Spain and in his early twenties. Such connections to Europe certainly would have given him access to such erotic artifacts, through his work with international merchants.</p>\n<p>Along with the \"obscene\" watch, a range of other items (including, for instance, immoral porcelain dolls) were also touched on in the case.  According to the suspect, these items all followed similar international trajectories between 1780 and 1783, when the Inquisition trial began: <strong><span style=\"font-family: Times; color: #7030a0;\">France </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">&gt; <span style=\"color: #7030a0;\">Spain </span>&gt; <span style=\"color: #7030a0;\">Venezuela </span>&gt; <span style=\"color: #7030a0;\">Cuba </span>&gt; <span style=\"color: #7030a0;\">Mexico City</span></span></strong>. Importantly, the trajectories that such an object might have followed in order to end up in the Rodríguez’s hands, point to the much larger transatlantic circulations of historical erotica, given that the provenance of this particular watch pointed simultaneously to artisans in France, to a Jewish woman in Nueva Granada, and to colonial functionaries in Mexico City. How it ended up from France, through Spain, into the Guárico in Venezuela and eventually to central Mexico, through Cuba, points to the many geographic (and gendered) traversals that erotic artifacts in the eighteenth century embodied. Perhaps it was Rodríguez’s own connections through his employment in the Secretaría del Virreinato, or perhaps merely through networks of friends and merchants, that gave him access to the watch. While we cannot know the motives behind his showing that particular object to Recarei y Camaño in 1783—perhaps he wanted to sell it, impress or humor a friend, or circulate knowledge about his possession of such a seemingly rare thing in the first place—we do learn about the contradictory narratives of the watch’s provenance, and what happened to it briefly in 1783: It was temporarily confiscated by the Inquisition, only to be returned to Rodríguez once inquisitors were convinced that its offending image had been “erased” from the watch.</p>\n<p>We too might turn, for instance, to some fifteen years prior: the 1767 Inquisition trial of a thirty 38-year-old man of French origins, don Pedro Caumont, who was found to have been in possession of <em>muñecos</em> (dolls or puppets) that contained several “lascivious and profane images and figures.”<a name=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\">[4]</a> As part of the investigation, inquisitors interrogated Caumont, and mandated that the local <em>comisario</em> or deputy of the Inquisition, Father Antonio Garcia Navarro, accompanied by the secretary of the Holy Office, don Pedro Bergoa, visit the shop to “make a formal spiritual registry […] of all he has in his shop, and in finding any dolls, boxes, toothpick holders, or clocks with the kind of obscene images that are represented or seen in the dolls […] that they confiscate and transport them to this Tribunal.” Inquisitors interrogated Baumont, who implicated another man, don Francisco Saldaña, in whose home inquisitors eventually discovered and confiscated some 32 porcelain figures that they deemed “obscene.” As inquisitors followed the case, they determined that the dolls indeed were French in origin, like their owner, and passed through Spain on their way into Mexico. </p>\n<p>Finally, we might turn to the 1777 investigation of a shopkeeper in Oaxaca, don Francisco Garfias, for possessing and selling printed images or engravings of French origin, some of which portrayed “madams that contained something indecent for having their breasts exposed.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[5]</a> Again, inquisitors took matters into their own hand, confiscating 465 of the potentially offensive images, 105 of them which were large prints, 200 medium-sized prints (200), and 160 miniature prints. Upon determining that “among the many decent figures […] one or another less modest figure does appear,” inquisitors returned all of the images to Garfias, warning him not to sell questionable images in the future. As Donahue-Wallace and Lamar Latham state, once again directing us toward absences, “The precise subject of the prints did not enter the archival record, but the obscene prints were nevertheless removed from Garfias’s wares.”<a href=\"#_edn2\">[6]</a></p>\n<p>All three of these late eighteenth-century Inquisition cases orient themselves around objects and images that embedded and produced particular types of information for different individuals, audiences, and institutions at overlapping moments in time. Inquisitors warned against the sale and circulation of similar items in the future, though, ultimately, they did not punish any of the men for their rather mundane transgressions. Inquisitors confiscated the potentially offensive objects (though only temporarily in the case of Garfias), and the confiscation acts made their way into the Inquisition’s inventories and handwritten records, where they continue to be represented textually and archivally. In all three of these cases, like so many others, the material objects themselves, many of which had putative ties to France—the figurines, boxes, clocks, and dolls that were confiscated by the Inquisition in the 1760s and in the 1780s, and the prints and images that were confiscated from Garfias in 1777, many of which were subsequently returned—no longer exist in archives among the files of the Inquisition. What we are left with are the textual representations of those objects embedded as information within the transcripts of Inquisition investigations and interrogations.</p>\n<p>Importantly, there is also a key degree of uncertainty that is related to temporality (and to the processes of narration and confession) here, which reflects the multitemporality and historical ambiguities around what Johanna Drucker tells us: “Humanists deal with the representation of temporality of documents (when they were created), in documents (narrated, represented, depicted temporality), the construction of temporality across documents (the temporality of historical events), and also the shape of temporality that emerges from documentary evidence (the shape of an era, a season, a period or epoch). They need a way to graph and chart temporality in an approach that suits the basic principles of interpretative knowledge.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[7]</a> The Flourish Connection Globe, on the one hand, does a good job of highlighting the <em>asserted </em>geographic flows, mediated by time, of a growing diversity of objects: obscene prints; clocks with indecent images; offending playing cards; indecent glass plates; immoral porcelain dolls, indecent songs, and obscene newspaper articles. Indeed, the Flourish Connection Globe enables website visitors to isolate the genre of censored artifacts to see how any given set of objects were <em>said to have </em>travelled from one place to another.</p>\n<p>Yet, at the same time, it (and the data that goes into it) is too merely a discursive construction on many levels. That is to say, how can we talk at face value <em>any </em>of the testimonies and \"confessions\" (voluntary or otherwise) that entered the transcripts of the Mexican Inquisition trial records?  If we return briefly, for instance, to the \"obscene\" watch and offending dolls that putatively made their way in the early 1780s from France to Mexico (via Spain, Venezuela, and Cuba), the fact that at least one witness offered a deviant provenance to these specific objects should complicate this graph, in terms of both data and visual representation.  (This is not yet something that I have been able to incorporate into the Flourish Connection Globe above, but want to think about how to best represent such contradictory trajectories and provenance of the very same item). The witness in this case, for instance, stated that the objects were indeed French in origin, but that they did not pass through Venezuela or Spain at all, but instead came directly through Cuba.  In the future, I could see myself using an alternate visualization, which would contain geographic connections that are represented with less visual certainty: perhaps dotted lines connecting places, with a popup to describe how and why the <em>actual </em>(i.e., the real) trajectories that these items often historically took were in and of themselves contradictory. Suspects, like don José Rodríguez, might have <em>merely asserted </em>that their items were previously owned by Jewish women in Venezuela, or merchants in Spain, simply to cover his own tracks, and to obscure rather than elucidate the actual provenance of the offending items. </p>\n<p><strong><em>My future goals for this Flourish Connection Globe include expanding my dataset and amplifying the scope of the data visualization by: </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>(1) </strong>Incorporating data from a growing corpus of Inquisition trial records, not just from Mexico, but also from the Inquisitions in Lima, Peru and Cartagena de Indias, Nueva Granada (today Colombia), I will have a much fuller version of what those global and local flows look like. This is painstaking work, however, which entails researching (and digitally photographing) dozens of not hundreds of Inquisition records in Mexico City, Mexico; Lima, Peru; Cartagena, Colombia; and Madrid, Spain (four cities in the Iberian Atlantic world that had independent tribunals of the Inquisition, and that over the course of the eighteenth century prosecuted a growing number of individuals on both sides of the Atlantic for the producing, selling, or distributing “obscene” artifacts). </p>\n<p><strong>(2) </strong>Finding a better way to better envision and visually represent both the uncertainty and conflicted trajectories that several of these items took. As with the watches discussed above, some items had multiple, overlapping, and contradictory trajectories as represented within the trials themselves. It would be interesting to find a platform, be it Flourish or something else, that would better enable me to visually represent these clashes and uncertainties, perhaps through the inclusion of more textual information, dotted lines, and color-coded lines that outlined different possible trajectories.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) </strong>Thinking about how to also represent the local production of those artifacts and images that were censored and confiscated by the Holy Office of the Inquisition. That is to say, in so many of the Mexican Inquisition trial records that I do have, owners and sellers did not deflect geographically (as the suspects in the cases discussed above may have), and they merely asserted that the “obscene” items were indeed Mexican in origin.  Since the current form of the Flourish Connection Globe I included here represents global, and not local, connections, in the future, I want to think about how to visually represent the <em>local </em>production and circulation of such items alongside the larger transatlantic circulations that are visible here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a> </p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-network\" data-src=\"visualisation/9029311\">\n<script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p>The second data visualization that I include here, above, is a Flourish Network Chart that is based on the 51 Spanish-language pornographic novels preserved in a physical box, “Caja Daniel” (or “Daniel’s Box”), that is housed at Archivo El Insulto, a community-based archives in Mexico City that manages, preserves, and exhibits records documenting explicit sexuality that have circulated in Mexico over the course of the twentieth century. Mexico lacks public archives that strategically collect <em>explicit</em> textual and photographic records on gender and sexuality toward diverse conservational, sociohistorical, and pedagogical ends, and there are simply no other archives in Mexico that strategically collect sexually explicit records for their historical value. Archivo El Insulto is therefore the only archives in Mexico that strategically acquires, preserves, and exhibits sexually explicit records for their long-term historical and cultural value. According to its mission statement, El Insulto “is a political and intellectual response to the absence of [such] an archive in Mexico, where one can go to encounter the erotic past and activate affective relationships with the materials.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[8]</a></p>\n<p>In 2017, Adolfo Vega—the founder and director of Archivo El Insulto—purchased this box with the words “<em>MATERIAL DANIEL</em>” scrawled across the top with a black marker—from a well-known Mexico City bookseller, Max Ramos (owner of the renowned Librería Jorge Cuesta), as a standalone collection from an unidentified individual, named Daniel, to whom these books once belonged. The books within “Caja Daniel” contain apocryphal dates and places of publication, which in many ways enhance their allure, gesturing to a certain unknowability surrounding their authorship, production, printing, and circulation. All of the books in “Caja Daniel” were purportedly printed between 1900 and 1953, hailing from a range of global cities including, most notably, Havana, Cuba; Madrid and Barcelona, Spain; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Paris, France; and individual publications from Tangier, Morocco; Rome, Italy; Guadalajara, Mexico; and New York, USA. Several titles published under the editorial names of “<em>Colección Lujuria</em>” (“Lust Collection,” making up 16 books); “<em>Colección Horas de Placer</em>” (“Collection Hours of Pleasure,” 10 books); “<em>Biblioteca H</em>” (“H Library,” 3 books); and sole books by “<em>Nueva Colección Placeres de la Carne</em>” (“New Collection Pleasure of the Flesh”); and “<em>Centro Editorial Fénix</em>” (“Phoenix Editorial Center”) among others. These primarily letterpress books range from 18 to 170 pages in length, and the majority of them contain between 5 and 10 (largely chromolithographic) pornographic illustrations—termed <em>ilustraciones</em>, <em>grabados</em>, and even “<em>expresivas láminas</em>” on the books’ covers—though the images range from 0 to 18, and in several cases, the images have been excised from individual books.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<p>What the Flourish Network Chart above aims to do is make visible some of the many geographic and linguistic connections—both real and imaginary—that the books embody in their supposed writing, illustration, printing, production, distribution, and consumption. In many ways, the Flourish Network Graph above makes it clear that, instead of the books preserved in “Caja Daniel” making up a haphazard collection of texts, the box itself represents a microcosm of a much larger world of Spanish-language print erotica and pornography, which staged both real and imagined geographic and cultural traversals, at once interconnections, overlapping, and contradictory. Rather than face the pressure (of an historian like myself) of trying to determine of any particular book in question was “Spanish” or “Cuban,” I argue that the books themselves are best seen as <em>composite</em> cultural products and material objects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<p>We see this, for instance, in one particular book in the collection, <em>Placeres tropicales</em> (Paris, 1910), written <em>Por Nobody </em>(“By Nobody”), which is the only book in Caja Daniel that I can say with certainty is a pirated Spanish translation of an 1894 English-language pornographic novel, most written by a man who had ample ties in the late nineteenth century to British, French, and Spanish erotica (with some connections through a particular agent in Mexico and the Caribbean who I am currently researching). It was through careful bibliographical research that I was able to confirm in recent months that <em>Placeres tropicales</em> is indeed a pirated translation of <em>The Adventures of Lady Harpur </em>(c. 1906), which itself was a partial rendition of the earlier anonymously written <em>The Adventures of Lady Harpur: her life of free enjoyment and ecstatic love adventures related by herself</em> (Manchester: Smith Bros., 1894), a copy of which is housed at the Kinsey Institute.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[9]</a> While I am still in the early process of attaining high-quality digital images of each of the pages of every book in “Caja Daniel,” in order to run particular books through Optical Character Recognition (in Spanish), I have been able to play around with <em>The Adventures of Lady Harpur</em> in Voyant Tools, below: </p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a></p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 800px;\" src=\"https://voyant-tools.org/?panels=cirrus%2Creader%2Ctrends%2Csummary%2Ccontexts&amp;corpus=f4cc3aa710f9984e077001761fe772d9\"></iframe></div>\n<p>And, while I am still skeptical of the value in computer textual analysis, what I find interesting here—and I eventually want to confirm through a close comparison of the English-language 1894 copy housed at the Kinsey Institute and the 1910 copy housed at Archivo El Insulto—are the potential changes and shifts that take place through the process of selective translation. The book problematically eroticizes blackness through the eyes of the interracial adolescent woman, Regin, and it performs a racialized erotics of slavery and plantation labor in eighteenth-century Haiti. Yet, the specific inclusion of Haiti is found <em>only</em> in the Spanish-language pirated translation. Indeed, the 1894 English-language text (that this <em>Placeres tropicales</em> is translated from) makes no mention of Haiti, but rather gestures more obliquely to “one of the West Indian islands.” In my larger project, I am interested in such seemingly minor shifts, which partly localize the consumption of race, bodies, and desire depending on whether reading practices took place in English (and in England) in the 1890s, or in Spanish (and in Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, or Spain) in the 1910s, as with <em>Placeres tropicales</em>. What Voyant Tools shows, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that the two most frequent words in Vol. 1 of <em>The Adventures of Lady Harpur </em>are related to the female and male genitalia, terms that in <em>Placeres tropicales </em>are most frequently rendered, respectively, as <em>coño </em>and <em>polla</em>—terms which gesture to this particular translation being either Spanish or Cuban rather than Mexican or Argentina. What, I think, would be actually useful in the future would be to compare, through Voyant, both the original English-language book as well as the Spanish-language translation, to see specifically when and where other linguistic and semantic shifts take place, especially in relation to race and blackness—concepts and phenomena whose meanings shift radically depending in place, time period, and cultural and geographic context of the act of readership.</p>\n<p>Returning to the above Network Flourish Chart, we also see, for instance, that several of the books published by “Colección Horas de Placer” were putatively published in Rome, New York, Buenos Aires, Paris, and unknown places of publication. Similarly, we could turn to “Colección Lujuria,” which supposedly published its books in Barcelona (1 book); Paris (1 book); Panama (1 book); Guadalajara (1 book); and Havana (16 books, hence the greater density of this line connecting publisher and city).  Some of these connections are evident in the above weighted Flourish Network Graph shows some of the many connections between individual publishers and the books’ supposed cities of publication—a social geography that creatively, imaginatively, and fictitiously maps the spread of Spanish-language erotica around the globe. Conspicuously absent in this network is Mexico, that is, with the sole exception of Colección Lujuria’s undated <em>Aventuras de un viajero</em>, which professes its place of publication as Guadalajara, Mexico. Yet, as my analysis below shows, some of the visual and material clues within certain books intimate that at least some of them were printed in Mexico (for Mexican readership). These books were made to travel, and traverse geographic and linguistic boundaries, they did. Yet, as Lisa Z. Sigel writes, histories of pornography are exceedingly difficult to document since the “writers, publishers, printers, vendors, and readers, for the most part, remain hidden from the historian.”<a href=\"#_edn1\">[10]</a> This certainly holds true for each and every one of the novels in “Caja Daniel.”</p>\n<p>Finally, while I have not yet done the necessary work (in part because I have not yet been able to gain access to the stag film collection housed at the Cineteca Nacional—and several years ago I was told by archivists that there were no such pornographic films there, despite the fact that there are well over 60 housed there, as discussed in a recent doctoral dissertation,<a href=\"#_edn1\">[11]</a> and also because I am awaiting a cache of Mexican and Cuban stag films donated by Albert Steg to the University of Toronto’s Sexual Representation Collection to be processed), in the long term, I have one other key aspect of this project that I think would benefit from data visualization. Given my own interest in the archiving and historical preservation of Latin American “stag films” (that is, silent black-and-white pornographic 35 mm or 16 mm film shorts that were filmed in the first half of the twentieth century, and were often screened with Spanish-language intertitle cards which depicted dialogue between characters), I would like to visually trace some of the filmic connections between several global repositories that contain Mexican, Cuban, Spanish, and Argentine stag films. Those repositories include, for instance, the Filmoteca de la UNAM in Mexico City; the Cineteca Nacional in Mexico City; the Kinsey Institute at the University of Indiana, Bloomington; and the University of Toronto Sexuality Representation Collection. </p>\n<p>What intrigues me most about this project—and would clearly benefit from a Digital Humanities data visualization—is that all of the above archives hold some copies of <em>the exact same stag films</em>, but in no case are the archived films actually identical (that is, the version of the same film that ended up in both archives through radically difference provenance were edited, spliced, translated, and pirated differently). Hence, it would be fascinating to see in which archives there are points of overlap in terms of collections content, but also where the more subtle difference can be found. In many cases, films of the same title (held at different archives) are films of different lengths that have been copied and pirated differently, and that are of different lengths. In other cases, what appear to be two different films (held at different archives) are actually the same film, that has nonetheless been edited, spliced, and copied differently.</p>\n<p>While I am still too early with my research to produce the necessary data for such a visualization, what I imagine such a graph or chart to show is something similar to that which we learn from “Caja Daniel” and from the eighteenth-century Mexican Inquisition trials: that it becomes exceedingly difficult to pin down the specific provenance of most of the objects and artifacts that have come to be historically labeled as “pornographic” or “obscene,” but that through careful textual and visual analysis, we can trace points of overlap, connection, and contradiction (in terms of production, circulation, and archivable object). That said, the history of pornography and erotica—especially as they come to be wrapped up with so many forms of historical censorship that lead us into the present—offers us with key challenges to better understand what an “obscene” object, artifact, or image is (or can be), and how at least some of its meanings become more visible to us through some of the tools within the growing field of the Digital Humanities.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\"></a>For more information: The video below is an online conversation, in Spanish, between me and Michelle Davó and Adolfo Vega of Archivo El Insulto, through <em>Moléculas Malucas </em>in Buenos Aires: </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dBedL9eJ9vk\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Below, you will also find a Facebook Live video conversation between Adolfo Vega and Michelle Davó (of Archivo El Insulto) and me, given at the modern art museum, Museo Leonora Carrington in San Luis Potosí.  This was an event titled \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?extid=NS-UNK-UNK-UNK-IOS_GK0T-GK1C&amp;ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=4183134575099868\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Historia sobre la sexualidad en México en el Siglo XX</a>.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ENDNOTES</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[1]</a> Kelly Donahue-Wallace and Elizabeth Alice Lamar Latham, “‘Not Just Indecent but Positively Obscene’: Lascivious Pictures and the Inquisition in New Spain, 1691-1821,” <em>Colonial Latin American Historical Review Volume</em> 16:3 (Summer 2007), 313-34, on 315.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[2]</a> Archivo General de la Nación, Mexico [hereafter AGN], Inquisición Vol. 1098, fs. 27-32v, on f. 27.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[3]</a> AGN, Inquisición Vol. 1098, f. 27v</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\">[4]</a> AGN, Inquisición Vol. 1085, fs. 334v.-339v.
