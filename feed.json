            "content_html": "<p>One of the most devastating archive events worldwide was the nitrate fire at the Cineteca Nacional—Mexico’s National Film Archives—on March 24, 1982. An unimaginable part of Mexico’s film heritage was lost: the fire destroyed some 6,506 films, 3,300 of which were Mexican features and shorts, as well as the Cineteca’s library, which held some 9,000 specialized books and film journals, 2,000 film scripts, and other irreplaceable print ephemera. Mexico’s silent films, largely produced between 1896 and 1929, are especially vulnerable as historical documents, and many were lost even prior to 1982. Archives such as the Filmoteca de la UNAM—founded in 1960 and housed in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México—have been crucial in recovering, restoring, and conserving Mexico’s film history, yet so too have private collectors, flea market dealers, and a range of other institutional and community-based archives, both within Mexico and in other countries, especially the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>Even more precarious than those films that were once archived (and later lost) are those that, because of their explicitly erotic or “pornographic” content were deemed by local authorities and the Catholic Church as “obscene,” and were therefore heavily censored and rarely ended up in <em>any</em> archival collection. So much of historical pornography (and “obscene” artifacts) enters and exits collections—being multiply used and reused, shifting hands of ownership, being censored, being discarded and disposed, being recovered, reentering circulation in the public sphere—and occasionally ending up in archives. Indeed, my own project began in 2017, when I purchased an amateur Mexican erotic film (an 8 mm film from the late 1960s, which features two woman and a man having sex) in a massive outdoor flea market in Mexico City, La Lagunilla, and subsequently donated that film to the Filmoteca de la UNAM, once of the country's most important film arvhies, housed at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Archivists at the Filmoteca warmly received my donation, and invited me to witness and participate in the process of restoring this film to include in the Filmoteca's collections and make it publicly available. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/FIGURE-2.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-2-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  alt=\"Antique vendor’s goods for sale at the Sunday morning market at La Lagunilla, with the 8 mm amateur Mexican pornographic film reel that I purchased and donated to the Filmoteca on the bottom right.\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\">\n<figcaption >Caption</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/FIGURE-3.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-md.jpeg 768w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/media/posts/1/responsive/FIGURE-3-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"  alt=\"Mario Tovar, of the Departmento de Catalogaci on of the Filmoteca de la UNAM, splicing and repairing damaged frames from the 8mm film that I donated to the archives.

This long-term project is twofold, and will culminate in a traditional scholarly monograph as well as in the creation of a digital archive that has become a necessary precondition for the research itself. This project will be the first of its kind to trace the unstable and constantly shifting ideas around obscenity in Latin American history. It too will be the first to digitally archive—in collaboration with the Mexico City-based community archives, <a href=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/introduction-to-archiving-the-obscene.html\" title=\"https://www.elinsulto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Archivo El Insulto</a>—a growing corpus of Latin American print, photographic, and moving image records related to histories of sexuality for the benefit of researchers, students, activists, archivists, collectors, and artists.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Digital Humanities course, I have decided to visualize three key aspects of this project, which help us gain a better sense of how \"obscene\" and putatively \"immoral\" artifacts traveled into Mexico, from the early eighteenth century to the present. My book, <em>Archiving the \"Obscene,\"</em> begins with the Bourbon Reforms, focusing on 1700-1821, when the various tribunals of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Mexico, Peru, and New Granada censored a diverse “obscene” or \"immoral\" artifacts including prints, etchings, drawings, glass plates, statues, dolls, and snuffboxes, among other items, punishing those who produced, commercialized or otherwise circulated them in the public sphere. In my larger project, I am working with dozens of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Inquisition records related to obscenity and pornography, many of which have been incisively analyzed by art historians Kelly Donahue-Wallace and Elizabeth Alice Lamar Latham, who point to the erotic “watches, snuff boxes, and other examples of visual culture that included indecent pictures [and] enriched the visual landscape of the late colonial period.”<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>My first such visualization below works through some of these connections, employing a Flourish Connections Globe to envision—through a handful eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Mexican Inquition trials—to think through some of the very real, partly imagined, and strategically fabricated trajectories which some of those confiscated \"immoral,\" \"obscene,\" and \"pornographic\" artifacts took. What I find particularly interesting about the graph below is that, in a very real sense (although currently my dataset is admittedly small, through the corpus is growing with each archival trip to Mexico City) we can see some of the ways that erotic artifacts spread across the globe, largely from Europe into Mexico. There are dozens of Mexican Inquisition cases (which I am still reading through) that gesture to the European provenance of such artifacts, yet there is a certain unknowability that adheres to the objects themselves, as confiscated, (temporarily?) archived, and eventually lost to posterity. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-globe\" data-src=\"visualisation/9016905\">\n<script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To get a more microhistorical sense of the cases themselves, and some of the \"obscene\" artifacts around which they revolved, I turn to fragments of the cases themselves. On October 20, 1783 a certain don Antonio Recarei y Camaño, boss of a Mexico City silversmith’s workshop in his late twenties, originally from Galicia, appeared before the <em>comisario </em>of the Holy Office of the Mexican Inquisition, Father don Manuel Bolea. He was called before inquisitors who were following up on a denunciation that he had previously made (which is not part of the archival record), and, like so many others who over the course of the eighteenth century increasingly and voluntarily denounced others for selling or possessing “obscene” images that they had encountered in bookstores, shops, and markets, he did so willingly. When asked if he knew the reasons for his having been summoned by order of the Holy Office, Recarei y Camaño replied that “he presumed being called to testify about an obscene painting that he was shown and presented by don José Rodríguez […] the said painting is found in the case of a French watch [<em>la caja de un reloj</em>] and that even though the said painting does not appear at first sight but upon winding up the spring, one us able to see a man and a woman in extremely dishonest and provocative action on the plate [<em>lámina</em>]” ((Archivo General de la Nación, Mexico [AGN], Inquisición 1098, fs. 27-32v, on f. 27).</p>\n<p>According to his testimony, Recarei y Camaño immediately reprimanded the owner of the watch, “telling him that it was a despicable [<em>indigna</em>] thing for a Christian to possess such jewelry, and that he was ready (if he wanted to) to erase it without prejudice against the watch; and that [he asked] ‘For what reason had he purchased such an evil piece?’” Rodríguez’s reply was telling: he was alleged to have replied that he had not purchased it but rather “that it was given to him by a Jewish woman [<em>una Judía</em>] in the Guárico,” a region located in what today is central Venezuela (AGN, Inquisición 1098, f. 27v.). Two days later, upon the inquisitors’ ratification of his testimony, Recarei y Camaño asserted that what he’d stated was true, but that he wanted to add that this took place on a feast day near the silversmith’s workshop, on the street of San Francisco “in the second house on the left-hand side,” pointing with specificity to the domestic sphere within which the offending watch was displayed. That Rodríguez exhibited his customized watch to the witness <em>only</em> when the two men were alone, in a private home, gestures to the clandestine homosocial nature of how such objects were often displayed, shared, and circulated locally. It also points to how such circulations were conditioned by gender, class, and religious difference (materialized through the accuser’s assertion that it was a <em>Jewish woman </em>who previously owned the obscene watch). As inquisitors delved more into the details of the suspect, they learned that Rodríguez was originally from Castilla la Vieja in Spain and in his early twenties. Such connections to Europe certainly would have given him access to such erotic artifiacts, through his work with international merchants.</p>\n<p>Along with the \"obscene\" watch, a range of other items (including, for instance, immoral porcelain dolls) were also touched on in the case.  According to the suspect, these items all followed similar international trajectories between 1780 and 1783, when the Inquisition trial began: <strong>France &gt; Spain &gt; Venezuela &gt; Cuba &gt; Mexico City</strong>. Importantly, the trajectories that such an object might have followed in order to end up in the Rodríguez’s hands, point to the much larger transatlantic circulations of historical erotica, given that the provenance of this particular watch pointed simultaneously to artisans in France, to a Jewish woman in Nueva Granada, and to colonial functionaries in Mexico City. How it ended up from France, through Spain, into the Guárico in Venezuela and eventually to central Mexico, through Cuba, points to the many geographic (and gendered) traversals that erotic artifacts in the eighteenth century embodied. Perhaps it was Rodríguez’s own connections through his employment in the Secretaría del Virreinato, or perhaps merely through networks of friends and merchants, that gave him access to the watch. While we cannot know the motives behind his showing that particular object to Recarei y Camaño in 1783—perhaps he wanted to sell it, impress or humor a friend, or circulate knowledge about his possession of such a seemingly rare thing in the first place—we do learn about the contradictory narratives of the watch’s provenance, and what happened to it briefly in 1783: It was temporarily confiscated by the Inquisition, only to be returned to Rodríguez once inquisitors were convinced that its offending image had been “erased” from the watch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"></a></p>\n<p>We too might turn, for instance, to some fifteen years prior: the 1767 Inquisition trial of a thirty 38-year-old man of French origins, don Pedro Caumont, who was found to have been in possession of <em>muñecos</em> (dolls or puppets) that contained several “lascivious and profane images and figures.”<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> As part of the investigation, inquisitors interrogated Caumont, and mandated that the local <em>comisario</em> or deputy of the Inquisition, Father Antonio Garcia Navarro, accompanied by the secretary of the Holy Office, don Pedro Bergoa, visit the shop to “make a formal spiritual registry […] of all he has in his shop, and in finding any dolls, boxes, toothpick holders, or clocks with the kind of obscene images that are represented or seen in the dolls […] that they confiscate and transport them to this Tribunal.” Inquisitors interrogated Baumont, who implicated another man, don Francisco Saldaña, in whose home inquisitors eventually discovered and confiscated some 32 porcelain figures that they deemed “obscene.” As inquisitors followed the case, they determined that the dolls indeed were French in origin, like their owner, and passed through Spain on their way into Mexico. </p>\n<p>Finally, we might turn to the 1777 investigation of a shopkeeper in Oaxaca, don Francisco Garfias, for possessing and selling printed images or engravings of French origin, some of which portrayed “madams that contained something indecent for having their breasts exposed.”<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>  Again, inquisitors took matters into their own hand, confiscating 465 of the potentially offensive images, 105 of them which were large prints, 200 medium-sized prints (200), and 160 miniature prints. Upon determining that “among the many decent figures […] one or another less modest figure does appear,” inquisitors returned all of the images to Garfias, warning him not to sell questionable images in the future. As Donahue-Wallace and Lamar Latham state, once again directing us toward absences, “The precise subject of the prints did not enter the archival record, but the obscene prints were nevertheless removed from Garfias’s wares.”<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All three of these late eighteenth-century Inquisition cases orient themselves around objects and images that embedded and produced particular types of information for different individuals, audiences, and institutions at overlapping moments in time. Inquisitors warned against the sale and circulation of similar items in the future, though, ultimately, they did not punish any of the men for their rather mundane transgressions. Inquisitors confiscated the potentially offensive objects (though only temporarily in the case of Garfias), and the confiscation acts made their way into the Inquisition’s inventories and handwritten records, where they continue to be represented textually and archivally. In all three of these cases, like so many others, the material objects themselves, many of which had putative ties to France—the figurines, boxes, clocks, and dolls that were confiscated by the Inquisition in 1767, and the prints and images that were confiscated from Garfias in 1777, many of which were subsequently returned—no longer exist in archives among the files of the Inquisition. What we are left with are the textual representations of those objects embedded as information within the transcripts of Inquisition investigations and interrogations.</p>\n<p>Yet, there is also a key degree of temporality and uncertainty here, which reflects what Johanna Drucker tells us: \"Humanists deal with the representation of temporality of documents (when they were created), in documents (narrated, represented, depicted temporality), the construction of temporality across documents (the temporality of historical events), and also the shape of temporality that emerges from documentary evidence (the shape of an era, a season, a period or epoch). They need a way to graph and chart temporality in an approach that suits the basic principles of interpretative knowledge.\" (See Johanna Drucker, “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” Digital Humanities Quarterly 5, no. 1 (2011)). The Flourish Connection Globe, on the one hand, does a good job of highlighting the <em>asserted </em>geographic flows of a growing diversity of objects: obscene prints; clocks with indecent images; offending playing cards; indecent glass plates; immoral porcelain dolls, indecent songs, and obscene newspaper articles. Yet, at the same time, it (and the data that goes into it) is too merely a discursive construction on many levels. That is to say, how can we talk at face value <em>any </em>of the testimonies and \"confessions\" (voluntary or otherwise) that entered the transcripts of the Mexican Inquisition trial records?  If we return briefly, for instance, to the \"obscene\" watch and offending dolls that putatively made their way in the early 1780s from France to Mexico (via Spain, Venezuela, and Cuba), the fact that at least one witness offered a deviant provenance to these specific objects should complicate this graph, in terms of both data and visual representation.  (This is not yet something that I have been able to incorporate into the Network Connection Globe above, but want to think about how to best represent such contradictory trajectories and provenance of the very same item). The witness in this case, for instance, stated that the objects were indeed French in origin, but that they did not pass through Venezula or Spain at all, but instead came directly through Cuba.  In the future, I could see myself using an alternate visualization, which would contain geographic connections that are represented with less visual certiantly: perhaps dotted lines connecting places, with a popup to descibe how and why the <em>actual </em>(i.e., the real) trajectories that these items often historically took were in and of themselves contradictory. Suspects, like don José Rodríguez, might have <em>merely asserted </em>that their items were previously owned by Jewish women in Venezuela, or merchants in Spain, simply to cover his own tracks, and to obscure rather than elucidate the actual provenance of the offending items. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-network\" data-src=\"visualisation/9029311\">\n<script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I envision that the final version will have at least 3 visualization components included on the website. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first visualization component of my paper will be a web map, that uses a handful of eighteenth-century Mexican Inquisition records—in which certain individuals were prosecuted for owning, selling, or circulations “obscene” images and “immoral” objects, such as dolls, figurines, clocks, snuffboxes, and printed images—to think about the provenance and circulations of some of these objects. Of my corpus of several dozen Inquisition trials, what I have found interesting is that many of these “obscene” and “pornographic” images were purported to have been produced in France, and made their (often through Spain, New Granada, and the Caribbean) to Mexico. While I admittedly do not know how helpful it will be to geospatially map the traces of these circulations, I am interested in playing around with different <strong><u>mapping tools</u></strong> to get a better sense of how some of these objects circulated in the eighteenth century. I might also be interested in producing <strong><u>a Flourish network chart</u></strong> to think about some of the connections between France, Spain, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. (<em>The caveat: my data set is admittedly small since while I have access to several dozen Mexican Inquisition trials, only a handful of these actually go into detail about the provenance of the so-called obscene, immoral, and pornographic images and artifacts)</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second visualization component will be stacked bar charts graphs representing a corpus of approximately 29 Mexican and Cuban stag films (i.e., silent black and white pornographic film shorts from the first half of the twentieth century) that are currently housed at the Filmoteca de la UNAM. I will (hopefully!) use <strong><u>OpenRefine</u></strong> to enter and standardize my data set (which will include information on the following: range of years of each film’s production; film reel format; information on language of film/intertitles; whether the film has closing credits, which though apocryphal, give us clues about production and/or pirating). I will then use <strong><u>Tableau Public</u></strong> to visualize some of this data. I am not yet sure how I want to proceed with this section, but I would like to see how I can visually represent uncertainty and ambivalence, along the lines of Johanna Drucker’s “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display”). Lastly, I am potentially interested in (textually and possibly visually) tracing connections between film overlaps between the Filmoteca de la UNAM and the Kinsey Institute. What intrigues my about this project is that both archives hold some of the exact same stag films, but in no case are the films identical (that is, the version of the same film that ended up in both archives through radically difference provenance were edited, spliced, translated, and pirated differently).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The third and possibly final visualization component will be some version of text analysis, based on <strong><u>Voyant</u></strong>. This will be based on a handful of Spanish-language erotic novels published between 1900 and 1953, that have come to be preserved in the collections of a Mexico City community-based archives, Archivo El Insulto, in a box labeled “Caja Daniel” (“Daniel’s Box,” which was named after its previous owner, and contains 41 novels from that same time period). I am currently trying to use Spanish-language OCR to produce text files of some of these erotic novels, and I expect Voyant to be able to allow me to better visualize, in particular, the diversity of slang terms that refer to the body, sexuality, and desire. While I expect will be interested is being able to see, primarily through textual analysis and computational literary analysis (CLS), how terms relating to the body can partly help determine if particular texts are of Spanish, Cuban, Mexican, or Argentinian origins. <em>Note: below you will find some videos I linked to this website that speak to my long-term collaborative efforts with Archivo El Insulto. </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given my own interest in the archiving and historical preservation of Latin American \"stag films\" (that is, silent black-and-white pornographic 35 mm or 16 mm film shorts that were filmed in the first half of the twentieth century, and were often screened with Spanish-language \"intertitle\" card, which depicted dialogue between characters), areas for future Digital Humanities research and visualizations might include, for instance, tracing some of the filmic connections between several global repositories that contain Mexican, Cuban, Spanish, and Argentine stag films. Those repositories include, for instance, the <a href=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/introduction-to-archiving-the-obscene.html\" title=\"https://www.filmoteca.unam.mx/nuestro-acervo/rescatar-preservar-y-difundir/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Filmoteca de la UNAM</a> in Mexico City; the<a href=\"https://zebjtort.github.io/eroticarchives/introduction-to-archiving-the-obscene.html\" title=\"https://www.cinetecanacional.net/controlador.php?opcion=acervo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Cineteca Nacional</a> in Mexico City; the Kinsey Institute at the University of Indiana, Bloomington; and the University of Toronto Human Sexuality Collection. </p>\n<p>See Archivo El Insulto below.  This is a grassroots queer archive that focuses on the preservation, display, and circulation of erotic materials that have circulated in Mexico over the course of the twentieth century: https://www.elinsulto.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The video below is an online conversation, in Spanish, between me and Michelle Davó and Adolfo Vega of Archivo El Insulto, through Moléculas Malucas: </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dBedL9eJ9vk\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Below, please find a Facebook Live video conversation between me, Adolfo Vega, and Michelle Davó (of Archivo El Insulto), through the modern art museum, Museo Leonora Carrington in San Luis Potosí.  This was an event titled \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?extid=NS-UNK-UNK-UNK-IOS_GK0T-GK1C&amp;ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=4183134575099868\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Historia sobre la sexualidad en México en el Siglo XX</a>.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>WORKS CITED: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Kelly Donahue-Wallace and Elizabeth Alice Lamar Latham, “‘Not Just Indecent but Positively Obscene’: Lascivious Pictures and the Inquisition in New Spain, 1691-1821,” <em>Colonial Latin American Historical Review Volume</em> 16:3 (Summer 2007), 313-34, on 315.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> Mexico, Archivo General de la Nación (AGN), Inquisición Vol. 1085, fs. 334v.-339v.
